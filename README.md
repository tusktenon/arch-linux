This is a collection of [meta packages](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Meta_package_and_package_group) for [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) and [Artix Linux](https://artixlinux.org/), which I wrote to make (re)installations faster and easier. You're welcome to use/modify them as you like, but please be aware that they reflect my own requirements and preferences and, in any case, are now several years out of date.
